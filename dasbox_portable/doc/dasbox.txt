Run your application:
  dasbox.exe <path_to_application_folder/file_name.das>

Optional comand line arguments:
  --dasbox-console - duplicate output to console ('--' is also acceptable)
  --trust - allow access to any file on this computer
  --disable-auto-upscale - disabling automatic zooming, by default the window will be zoomed in 2 times, if the window is 2.5 times less than the desktop resolution

Once the application is running, all the sources ('file_name.das' and all the sources requested from it) will be checked for changes and automatically reloaded.
The current directory will change to 'path_to_application_folder'. For security reasons access to parent directories from within the script will be forbidden.

Tab - switch to the logging screen and back
Alt+F1 or Alt+Ctrl+P - show profile information

In the log screen your application will be paused.
